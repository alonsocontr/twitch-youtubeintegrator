# twitch-youtubeintegrator
This lightweight project utilizes Youtube's live video playback and Twitch's live chat. This is suitable for viewers that enjoy the comfort of Youtube viewing while still having the personality that a Twitch chat could offer. This works best when a streamer is multi-streaming (streaming on Youtube&amp;Twitch)
