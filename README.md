# twitch-youtubeintegrator
This lightweight project utilizes Youtube's live video playback and Twitch's live chat. This is suitable for viewers that enjoy the comfort of Youtube viewing while still having the personality that a Twitch chat could offer. This works best when a streamer is multi-streaming (streaming on Youtube&amp;Twitch)

Currently, this project is hardcoded to only one streamer, Jynxzi. With additional API's from Youtube and Twitch, a search prompt could be created for a user to select any streamer they wish to watch. Currently, there are no error checks for when someone is live. Also, current Youtube URLs are hardcoded.
